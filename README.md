# FarmProtectForked
A Minecraft Plugin Forked from Jacklin213's FarmProtect 1.9.0

FarmProtectForked is a Paper plugin that makes sure NOBODY (including your self) makes farmland turn back to normal by either jumping on it or walking over it. It has some configurable features for people that like to tweak around with the configuration. 

##### MultiWorld Support
You can now choose to select which worlds you want to protect and which worlds you don't.
By default this feature is turned off. You can turn it on by either editing the config or using the command /fp toggle multiworld. You can add and remove worlds from this list at any time using /fp add , /fp remove respectively

##### ExplosionProtect Support
You can protect your farmland from any sort of explosion. It is on by default and can be set by this value in the config:

To turn it off edit the config or just use /fp toggle explosionprotect
